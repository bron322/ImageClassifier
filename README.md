### Image Classifier for Happy or Sad Face Prediction

This repository contains a simple image classifier implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to predict whether a person in a photo is displaying a happy or sad face.

#### Overview

The image classifier model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification tasks. The model architecture consists of several Conv2D layers followed by MaxPooling2D layers to extract relevant features from input images. The final layers include a Flatten layer to flatten the feature maps and fully connected Dense layers for classification.

#### Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Layers:** The model contains multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation functions to perform feature extraction from input images. The number of filters and kernel size in each Conv2D layer is configurable.
- **MaxPooling Layers:** MaxPooling2D layers are used to downsample the feature maps produced by convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions and computational complexity of the model.
- **Flatten Layer:** The Flatten layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing them for input into the fully connected Dense layers.
- **Dense Layers:** The Dense layers perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers. The final output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to produce a probability score indicating the likelihood of the input image containing a happy face.

#### Usage

1. **Training the Model:** Train the image classifier model using a dataset containing labeled images of happy and sad faces. Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
2. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance and generalization ability.
3. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new images of faces to determine whether they are happy or sad.
